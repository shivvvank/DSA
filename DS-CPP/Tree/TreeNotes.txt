Types Of Trees 
1. Full binary tree (0 or 2 children)
2. Complete binary tree (all level filled except last - left as possible)
3. Perfect binary tree (all leaf at same level)
4. Balanced binary tree (max height = log2N ,N=no of nodes)
5. Degenerate binary tree (single child for every node except last)

Representation in C++

struct Node {
    int val;
    Node * left;
    Node * right;
    Node(int val)
    {
        this->val=val;
    }
    Node(int val , Node * left, Node * right)
    {
        this->val = val;
        this->left = left;
        this->right=right;
    }
}

Tree Traversal 
1. PreOrder : using recursion | using 1 stack (right then left push to stack) 
2. InOrder : using recursion | using 1 stack & 1 node based upon if node!=nullptr go to left and push to stack
2.                go to that node, if node is nullptr then save in vector or print and pop  
3. PostOrder : using recursion | using 2 stacks Iterative | using 1 stack
