Tree Types :
//Full BT : every node 0 or 2 children
//Complete BT : all level completely filled except last and left inclned
//Perfect BT : leaf nodes at same level
//Balanced BT : diff btw left height and right heght is less than 1 
//Degenerate BT : like a list 

Tree Traversal:
Preorder
Inorder
Postorder
